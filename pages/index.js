        <p>My name is John Pe√±a and I am a real estate agent with eXp Realty. I got into real estate in January of 2020, about a month before coronavirus blew up the world.</p>

        <p>As a former teacher, I know how to find, digest, and deliver information. My original intention was to start a book club for new agents in order to learn from the most successful people in the industry through books like "The One Thing" by Gary Keller, "Sell It Like Serhant" by Ryan Serhant, and "The Greatest Salesman in the World" by Og Mandino.</p>

        <p>The pandemic made a book club unrealistic, which helped me realize that there are a LOT of new real estate agents out there, probably going through the same growing pains as myself. So, why not create a community for them?</p>

        {screenSize === 'mobile' && (
          <img src='https://res.cloudinary.com/mimas-music/image/upload/v1597532361/New%20Agent%20Mindset/successful-agent-m.jpg' alt='successful-agent-mindset' title='successful-agent-mindset' />
        )}

        {screenSize === 'desktop' && (

        )}

        <p>And that is exactly what <i>New Agent Mindset</i> is, a community for new real estate agents looking to build a successful business quickly and efficiently! Aside from studying and delivering content from the best voices in the industry, I will also share as much useful advice as I possibly can from my own ups and downs.</p>

        <p>It's my greatest desire that new real estate agents will find VALUE and community here. So, what are we waiting for, let's begin!</p>
